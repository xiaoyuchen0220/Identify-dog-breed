# Identify-dog-breed-AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is intent to help identify the dog breed and behavior via images for provide precise advices to who want to adopt a dog, help people find the proper dog to suit their lifestyle.


## Background

It is difficult for adopters to accurately know the breed of dogs from pictures, especially stray dogs, which are often hybrids of several breed. 


## How is it used?

Adopters will fill out a questionnaire and upload a photo of the dog they want to adopt to the website. The system will automatically analyze the breed of the dog, display the matching degree in the form of a radar map, and give some guidance and suggestions for adoption.

## Data sources and AI methods

Initially, I plan to use dataset from "Dog Breeds Drawings & Dimensions" (https://www.dimensions.com/collection/dogs-dog-breeds). In addition, I will collect and labelling some image through the database to make sure the process would work well.

## Challenges

The project needs to collect huge pictures and data, as well as complete dog species identification through deep learning，I think that's a big challenge. Furthermore，the confidentiality of personal information is subject to strict compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## What next?

In the next step, I need to continue to learn deep learning knowledge and improve my programming ability.The project will start with basic pattern recognition and, if successful, improve the program's ability to learn and recognize more complex patterns.
